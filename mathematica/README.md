#Mathematica
This implementation uses straightforward Mathematica 10.x functionality.

It's using a fixed string match since FindList doesn't support regex.

The script runner is for OS X only and assumes the default install location. I don't have access to Linux Mathematica to test.

My Late 2013 MacBook Pro runs this cold in ~2.2s, warm ~1.8s.
